## How to use
### Settomg world type on singleplayer
You can simply set `World Type` to `Skyblock` when creating a new world on click on `More World Options...`

### Setting world type on server
You can simply set `level-type` in `server.properties` to `custom_skyblock`.

### Creating a custom skyblock island
1. Build an island.
2. Use the vanilla Structure Block if your island is smaller or equals 48x48x48 blocks to save it as a `.nbt` file. 
Otherwise you need to use a mod like [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) to generate this file.
3. Copy the generated file from `saves/<world>/generated/minecraft/structures/<name>.nbt` to `config/skyblockbuilder/template.nbt`.
4. Set the possible spawns in `config/skyblockbuilder/spawns.json`. There can be multiple spawns, each one is an array with `[x, y, z]`
relative to the 0, 0, 0 from the template structure. 
5. To view your current spawns, you need to use the `/reload` command to reload the config. After that, you need to use the 
`/skyblock spawns` command to view all possible spawn points.
6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until everything is correct.

### Possible spawns
Possible spawns are set in `config/skyblockbuilder/spawns.json`. For each player, the game will choose a random position
and places the player on that position. Good on big islands when adding a lot of players at once at one team.

### Loot chests on island
If you want a loot chest on an island, you need to set the NBT data to the chest with the `/data merge block x y z {LootTable: modid:path/to/loot_table}`
command to set it as loot chest. WARNING! Do not open that chest after merging this data into the chest.

### Allow structures to be generated
Structures can be generated by changing the config at `config/skyblockbuilder/config.toml`. Nether structures are generated 
by default but you can turn that off. Overworld structures are not being generated by default.


## Using teams
Only an operator with permission level 2 or higher can change anything at teams.
### Creating teams
Use the `/skyblock teams create <name>` command to generate a team with the given name. If no name if provided, a random
name will be generated.

Alternatively (good for servers) you can use `/skyblock teams createAndJoin <name>` to create the team and join it.

### Deleting teams
Use the `/skyblock teams delete <name>` to delete the team with the given name. WARNING! This cannot be undone. The island
will still exist but you can't re-bind a new team to that island. If users are in the team, they will be teleported to spawn 
after dropping all their items.

### Clearing teams
Because teams can be empty, you can "clear" all islands. If you use `/skyblock teams clear <name>`, all empty teams will be deleted 
as in [Deleting teams](#deleting-teams).

If you provide a team name, all players from this team will be removed and teleported to spawn island.

### Joining a team
An operator need to add players to a team. For that, they need to use `/skyblock teams join <team_name> <player>`.
Then the player will be teleported to the teams island.

### Leaving a team
An operator need to remove players from a team. For that, they need to use `/skyblock teams remove <player>`. The removed
player will be teleported back to spawn after dropping all the items in the inventory.

If you're not op and want to leave your team, you can simply type in `/skyblock leave`. You will drop all your items and 
be teleported to spawn.

### Listing teams
Everyone can list the teams. For that, you can use `/skyblock list <name>`. That will list either all the teams if no 
name is provided or the names of all players in a team.

### Inviting users
Everyone in a team can invite other players. For that, you can use `/skyblock invite <player>`. That will send an invitation 
to the given player. Only players with no team can be invited.

### Accepting invitations
Everyone with an invitation can accept them. You can only accept invitations if you're in no team. For that, you use 
the command `/skyblock accept <team>`.
